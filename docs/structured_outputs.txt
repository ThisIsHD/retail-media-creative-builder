</Tip>

<Warning>
  Structured outputs with strict adherence is currently in beta, released in version 1.23 of the Cerebras Inference Cloud SDK. Improvements for speed and expanded support will be released in coming weeks, with documentation updated accordingly.
</Warning>

Structured outputs is a feature that can enforce consistent JSON outputs for models in the Cerebras Inference API. This is particularly useful when building applications that need to process AI-generated data programmatically. Some of the key benefits of using structured outputs are:

* **Reduced Variability**: Ensures consistent outputs by adhering to predefined fields.
* **Type Safety**: Enforces correct data types, preventing mismatches.
* **Easier Parsing & Integration**: Enables direct use in applications without extra processing.

## Tutorial: Structured Outputs using Cerebras Inference

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use structured outputs with the Cerebras Cloud SDK. We'll build a simple application that generates movie recommendations and uses structured outputs to ensure the response is in a consistent JSON format.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Setup">
    First, ensure that you have completed steps 1 and 2 of our [Quickstart Guide](/quickstart) to set up your API key and install the Cerebras Cloud SDK.

    Then, initialize the Cerebras client and import the necessary modules we will use in this tutorial.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```python Python theme={null}
      import os
      from cerebras.cloud.sdk import Cerebras
      import json

      client = Cerebras(
          api_key=os.environ.get("CEREBRAS_API_KEY")
      )
      ```

      ```javascript Node.js theme={null}
      import Cerebras from '@cerebras/cerebras_cloud_sdk';

      const client = new Cerebras({
        apiKey: process.env['CEREBRAS_API_KEY']
      });
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Defining the Schema">
    To ensure structured responses from the model, we'll use a JSON schema to define our output structure. Start by defining your schema, which specifies the fields, their types, and which ones are required. For our example, we'll define a schema for a movie recommendation that includes the title, director, and year:

    <Warning>
      Note: For every `required` array you define in your schema, you must set `additionalProperties` to `false`.
    </Warning>

    <CodeGroup>
      ```python Python theme={null}
      movie_schema = {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
              "title": {"type": "string"},
              "director": {"type": "string"},
              "year": {"type": "integer"},
          },
          "required": ["title", "director", "year"],
          "additionalProperties": False
      }
      ```

      ```javascript Node.js theme={null}
      const movieSchema = {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
              title: { type: "string" },
              director: { type: "string" }, 
              year: { type: "integer" },
          },
          required: ["title", "director", "year"],
          additionalProperties: false
      };
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Using Structured Outputs">
    Next, use the schema in your API call by setting the `response_format` parameter to include both the type and your schema. Setting `strict` to `true` will enforce the schema. Setting `strict` to `false` will allow the model to return additional fields that are not specified in the schema, similar to [JSON mode](#json-mode).

    <CodeGroup>
      ```python Python theme={null}
      completion = client.chat.completions.create(
          model="gpt-oss-120b",
          messages=[
              {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that generates movie recommendations."},
              {"role": "user", "content": "Suggest a sci-fi movie from the 1990s"}
          ],
          response_format={
              "type": "json_schema", 
              "json_schema": {
                  "name": "movie_schema",
                  "strict": True,
                  "schema": movie_schema
              }
          }
      )

      # Parse the JSON response
      movie_data = json.loads(completion.choices[0].message.content)
      print(json.dumps(movie_data, indent=2))
      ```

      ```javascript Node.js theme={null}
      async function main() {
        const schemaCompletion = await client.chat.completions.create({
          model: 'gpt-oss-120b',
          messages: [
            { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant that generates movie recommendations.' },
            { role: 'user', content: 'Suggest a sci-fi movie from the 1990s' }
          ],
          response_format: {
            type: 'json_schema', 
            json_schema: {
              name: 'movie_schema',
              strict: true,
              schema: movieSchema
            }
          }
        });
        
        // Parse and display the JSON response 
        const schemaMovieData = JSON.parse(schemaCompletion.choices[0].message.content);
        console.log('Movie Recommendation:');
        console.log(JSON.stringify(schemaMovieData, null, 2));
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Sample output:

    ```
    {
      "title": "The Fifth Element",
      "director": "Luc Besson",
      "year": 1997
    }
    ```

    Now you have a structured JSON response from the model, which can be used in your application.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Schema References and Definitions

You can use `$ref` with `$defs` to define reusable schema components within your JSON schema. This is useful for avoiding repetition and creating more maintainable schemas.

```python highlight={5,7-8} theme={null}
schema_with_defs = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "title": {"type": "string"},
        "director": {"$ref": "#/$defs/person"},
        "year": {"type": "integer"},
        "lead_actor": {"$ref": "#/$defs/person"},
        "studio": {"$ref": "#/$defs/studio"}
    },
    "required": ["title", "director", "year"],
    "additionalProperties": False,
    "$defs": {
        "person": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "name": {"type": "string"},
                "age": {"type": "integer"}
            },
            "required": ["name"],
            "additionalProperties": False
        },
        "studio": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "name": {"type": "string"},
                "founded": {"type": "integer"},
                "headquarters": {"type": "string"}
            },
            "required": ["name"],
            "additionalProperties": False
        }
    }
}
```

## Advanced Schema Features

Your schema can include various JSON Schema features:

* **Fundamental Data Types**: String, Number, Boolean, Integer, Object, Array, Enum, null.
* **Union Types**: Use `anyOf` to allow the model to return one of multiple possible types (max of 5). Note: The shorthand `"type": [ … ]` is not supported. See [schema limitations](#schema-limitations) for an example.
* **Nested structures**: Define complex objects with nested properties, with support for up to 5 layers of nesting. You can also use definitions to reference reusable schema components.
* **Required fields**: Specify which fields must be present.
* **Additional properties**: Control whether extra fields are allowed. Note: the only accepted value is `false`. For every `required` array you define in your schema, you must set `additionalProperties` to `false`.
* **Enums (value constraints)**: Use the `enum` keyword to whitelist the exact literals a field may take. See `rating` in the example below.

For example, a more complex schema might look like:

```python  theme={null}
detailed_schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "title": {"type": "string"},
        "director": {"type": "string"},
        "year": {"type": "integer"},
        "genres": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {"type": "string"}
        },
        "rating": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": ["G", "PG", "PG‑13", "R"]
        },
        "cast": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "name": {"type": "string"},
                    "role": {"type": "string"}
                },
                "required": ["name"],
                "additionalProperties": False
            }
        }
    },
    "required": ["title", "director", "year", "genres"],
    "additionalProperties": False
}
```

When used with the API, you might get a response like:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "title": "Jurassic Park",
  "director": "Steven Spielberg",
  "year": 1993,
  "genres": ["Science Fiction", "Adventure", "Thriller"],
  "cast": [
    {"name": "Sam Neill", "role": "Dr. Alan Grant"},
    {"name": "Laura Dern", "role": "Dr. Ellie Sattler"},
    {"name": "Jeff Goldblum", "role": "Dr. Ian Malcolm"}
  ]
}
```

## Working with Pydantic and Zod

Besides defining a JSON schema manually, you can use Pydantic (Python) or Zod (JavaScript) to create your schema and convert it to JSON. Pydantic's `model_json_schema` and Zod's `zodToJsonSchema` methods generate the JSON schema, which can then be used in the API call, as demonstrated in the workflow above.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python (Pydantic) theme={null}
  from pydantic import BaseModel
  import json

  # Define your schema using Pydantic
  class Movie(BaseModel):
      title: str
      director: str 
      year: int 

  # Convert the Pydantic model to a JSON schema
  movie_schema = Movie.model_json_schema()

  # Print the JSON schema to verify it
  print(json.dumps(movie_schema, indent=2))
  ```

  ```javascript Node.js (Zod) theme={null}
  import { z } from 'zod';
  import { zodToJsonSchema } from 'zod-to-json-schema';

  // Define your schema using Zod
  const MovieSchema = z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    director: z.string(),
    year: z.number().int()
  });

  // Convert the Zod schema to a JSON schema
  const movieJsonSchema = zodToJsonSchema(MovieSchema, { name: 'movie_schema' });

  // Print the JSON schema to verify it
  console.log(JSON.stringify(movieJsonSchema, null, 2));
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## JSON Mode

In addition to structured outputs, you can also use JSON mode to generate JSON responses from the model. This approach tells the model to return data in JSON format but doesn't enforce a specific structure. The model decides what fields to include based on the context of your prompt.

<Note>
  We recommend using structured outputs with `strict` set to `true` whenever possible, as it provides more predictable and reliable results.
</Note>

To use JSON mode, set the `response_format` parameter to `json_object`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  completion = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="gpt-oss-120b",
      messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that generates movie recommendations."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Suggest a sci-fi movie from the 1990s"}
      ],
      response_format={"type": "json_object"}
  )
  ```

  ```javascript Node.js theme={null}
  async function main() {
    const jsonModeCompletion = await client.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'gpt-oss-120b',
      messages: [
        { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant that generates movie recommendations.' },
        { role: 'user', content: 'Suggest a sci-fi movie from the 1990s' }  
      ],
      response_format: {
        type: 'json_object'
      }
    }); 
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Limitations

* JSON mode is not compatible with streaming. `stream` must be set to `false`.
* You must explicitly instruct the model to generate JSON through a system or user message.

### Structured Outputs vs JSON Mode

The table below summarizes the key differences between Structured Outputs and JSON Mode:

| Feature            | Structured Output                                                                        | JSON Mode                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Outputs valid JSON | Yes                                                                                      | Yes                                        |
| Adheres to schema  | Yes (enforced)                                                                           | No (flexible)                              |
| Enabling           | `response_format: { type: "json_schema", json_schema: {"strict": true, "schema": ...} }` | `response_format: { type: "json_object" }` |

## Variations from OpenAI's Structured Output Capabilities

While our structured output capabilities closely match OpenAI's implementation, there are a few key differences to note.

<Note>
  These limitations only apply if `strict` is set to `true` in the JSON schema.
</Note>

<Accordion title="Schema Limitations">
  * Recursive JSON schemas are not currently supported.
  * Maximum schema length is limited to 5,000 characters.
  * No error is thrown when `additionalProperties` is not explicitly set to false. We quietly handle this case.
  * Union shorthand `"type": ["string", "null"]` is not supported. Use `anyOf` instead, and remember that all properties must be listed in the `required` array. See the example below.

  ```json  theme={null}
    {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "recordId": {
        "anyOf": [
          { "type": "string" },
          { "type": "null" }
        ]
      }
    },
    "required": ["recordId"],
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Property Handling">
  * Every property defined in `properties` must also appear in the `required` array.  If a property may be `null`, keep it in `required` and add a union with `anyOf`.
  * Omitted optional properties are not treated as errors.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Array Validation">
  * `items: true` is not supported for JSON schema array types.
  * `items: false` is supported when used with `prefixItems` for tuple-like arrays with validation rules.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Schema Structure">
  * `$anchor` keyword is not supported - use relative paths within definitions/references instead.
  * Use `$defs` instead of `definitions` for reusable schema components.
  * Additional informational fields meant as guidelines (not used in validation) are not supported.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Supported Reference Patterns">
  <Danger>
    For security reasons, external schema references are not supported.
  </Danger>

  * Internal definitions are supported: `"$ref": "#/$defs/cast_member"`
  * Other reference access patterns are not recommended, and will be deprecated in future releases. See [Schema References and Definitions](#schema-references-and-definitions) for more info.
</Accordion>

<Warning>
  Structured outputs do not work with function calling yet. This feature will be supported in a future release.
</Warning>

## Conclusion

Structured outputs with JSON schema enforcement ensures your AI-generated responses follow a consistent, predictable format. This makes it easier to build reliable applications that can process AI outputs programmatically without worrying about unexpected data structures or missing fields.
